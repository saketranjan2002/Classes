We should never store images,videos etc inside the DB. 
1) Things that we need to search on eg user, employee, Video metadata etc should be stored at DB
2) Rest things are stored at object stores
3) AWS have its own store called S3 (simple storage service version 3)
4) 


Distribution 
1) CDN (content delivery networks) are used to distributed single source of truth effectively.
2) you get charged for both storage and distribution.
3) Cloudfront is an example of CDN (it will have an distribution URL and an origin)


file in s3   <--                  cf1 
 |      |    \
cf2     cf3   cf4

cf1,cf2,cf3 etc are cloudfront servers (Technically called POPS) spread across the globe to help deliver s3 file effectively.

POP = Point Of Presense

Distribution cost is higher than storage cost.



Why Backend can be distributed via backend ?
# Backend data can be user specific, so we can't really cache the data. Hence edgenetwork is used.
