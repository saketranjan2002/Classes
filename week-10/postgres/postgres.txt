Using a library that let’s you connect and put data in it.

1. psql
is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It provides an interactive command-line interface to the PostgreSQL (or TimescaleDB) database. With psql, you can type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results.
How to connect to your database?
psql Comes bundled with postgresql. You don’t need it for this tutorial. We will directly be communicating with the database from Node.js

psql -h p-broken-frost-69135494.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech -d database1 -U 100xdevs



2. pg
pg is a Node.js library that you can use in your backend app to store data in the Postgres DB (similar to mongoose). We will be installing this eventually in our app.
